      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a senior studying computer engineering. I occasionally enjoy long walks on the beach.
        However, sitting at home doing nothing is also super enjoyable. I have recently enjoyed
        watching Psych, Mentalist, Monk, Andor, and the Manalorian. I love playing video games like
        Rimworld, Mount & Blade, Terraria, and Stellaris. I currently host a heavily modded minecraft
        server for my sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am taking this class to get a cs minor and to learn how to css. I cannot wait till I graduate
        because senioritis is a real thing. Hopefully you were not too bored with my description of
        myself. Also If you are still reading this, You probably should have stopped with the first
        sentence.

      <h2>Start up project</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever wanted to run a server for each of the games you played? Or maybe you want
        to be able to swap what server is currently running without a hassle. You can with the
        Server handler! The Server Handler makes running servers easy by telling you exactly
        what you want to know. It includes images of your previous servers already set up as
        well as what servers are already running! Find the code <a href="https://github.com/Clark737/startup">here</a>!

      <h2>Simon project</h2>
      <p>
        In 1978 Milton-Bradley, now Hasbro, released an electronic game named Simon. It was
        cutting edge at the time since there were so few electronic games, and all the cool
        kids had one. I will be making a web version for my cs 260 class the code can be
        found <a href="https://github.com/Clark737/Simon">here</a>.
